                <div class="">
                    What I hope to get out of Is 413 is the ability to code confidently in C# as well as in the framework ASP.net
                    So Far I have learned framework like django and coding language like python and javascript that are not strongly typed. I hope to
                    gain a better understanding of this type of coding and can put on my resume that I now these hard skills.
                    Another thing that I hope to get out of Is 413 is the ability to think logicially and be able to
                    apply to other coding lanugauge and learn other languages faster.
